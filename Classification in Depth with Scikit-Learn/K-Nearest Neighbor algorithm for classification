1. Performance evaluation

What is accuracy of training and testing data?

Round to two decimal places

The accuracy of the test set is 0.90

The accuracy of the test set is 0.80

The accuracy of the train set is 0.78

The accuracy of the test set is 0.90

=> The accuracy of the test set is 0.90

The accuracy of the test set is 0.90


2. Test time versus train time

k-NN algorithm does more computation on test time rather than train time.

No

Yes

=> Yes


3. KNN uses

Which of the following option is true about KNN algorithm?

It can be used in both classification and regression

It can be used for regression

It can be used for classification

=> It can be used in both classification and regression


4. 
Assumptions

Which of the following statement is true about KNN algorithm ?

KNN performs much better if all of the data have the same scale.

KNN works well with a small number of input variables.

k-NN makes assumptions about the functional form of the problem being solved.

=> KNN performs much better if all of the data have the same scale.

KNN works well with a small number of input variables.
