1. Performance evaluation

What is accuracy of training and testing data?

Round to two decimal places

The accuracy of the train set is 0.93

The accuracy of the train set is 0.78

The accuracy of the test set is 0.80

The accuracy of the test set is 0.90

=> The accuracy of the train set is 0.93

The accuracy of the test set is 0.90
