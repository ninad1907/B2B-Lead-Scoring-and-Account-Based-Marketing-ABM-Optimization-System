Q1. What are classification capstone projects, and why are they important for learning?**  
A: Classification capstone projects are comprehensive, real-world machine learning projects where students or practitioners apply classification algorithms to solve a specific problem. These projects often involve collecting and preprocessing data, selecting a suitable classification algorithm, and evaluating model performance. They are important because they provide hands-on experience and demonstrate the ability to solve practical problems using classification techniques.

Q2. Can you give an example of a classification capstone project?**  
A: An example of a classification capstone project is predicting whether a customer will buy a product (binary classification). The project would involve analyzing customer demographic data, website interaction history, and purchase history, and then using a classification algorithm like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict whether a new customer will buy the product or not. The performance of the model would be evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Q3. What are the key steps involved in a classification capstone project?**  
A: The key steps in a classification capstone project are:  
1. Problem Definition**: Understand the problem and define the classification task.  
2. Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Gather relevant data, clean it, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables.  
3. Feature Engineering**: Select and create meaningful features that help improve model performance.  
4. Model Selection**: Choose appropriate classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM).  
5. Model Training**: Train the model using the training data.  
6. Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, etc.  
7. Model Tuning**: Fine-tune the model (e.g., hyperparameter optimization) to improve performance.  
8. Model Deployment**: (Optional) Deploy the model for real-world use, if applicable.
