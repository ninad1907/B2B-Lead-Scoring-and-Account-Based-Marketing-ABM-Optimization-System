Q1. What is a linear machine learning model?**  
A: A linear machine learning model makes predictions based on a linear combination of the input features. The model assumes a linear relationship between the input variables and the output. Examples include Linear Regression and Logistic Regression.

Q2. How does Linear Regression work?**  
A: Linear Regression predicts a continuous output by finding the best-fit straight line (defined by \( y = mx + b \)) that minimizes the error between the predicted and actual values. The error is typically minimized using the least squares method.

Q3. What are the key assumptions of linear models?**  
A: 
1. **Linearity**: The relationship between input and output is linear.  
2. **Independence**: Observations are independent of each other.  
3. **Homoscedasticity**: The variance of the errors is constant.  
4. **No Multicollinearity**: Independent variables should not be highly correlated.
