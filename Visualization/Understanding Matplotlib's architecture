### **1. Creating a Figure and Axis in Matplotlib**

Use the `subplots` function to create a Figure (`fig`) and an Axes (`ax`) object.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a figure and axis
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Display the empty plot
plt.show()
```

### **2. Understanding Figures and Axes in Matplotlib**

The correct answer is:
**A Figure is the entire plotting area or canvas, while an Axes is an individual plot within the Figure.**

#### Explanation:
- **Figure**: The overall container that holds all the elements of a plot, including axes, titles, and labels. Think of it as the "canvas."
- **Axes**: Represents an individual plot within the Figure. It's where data is plotted (e.g., a graph, histogram, or scatter plot).

### **3. Create a Basic Line Plot**

Plot a line chart using the data `x = [2, 4, 6, 8]` and `y = [15, 30, 45, 60]`.

```python
# Data for the plot
x = [2, 4, 6, 8]
y = [15, 30, 45, 60]

# Create a figure and axis
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Plot the data
ax.plot(x, y)

# Add labels and title
ax.set_title('Basic Line Plot')
ax.set_xlabel('X-axis')
ax.set_ylabel('Y-axis')

# Display the plot
plt.show()
```

### Key Points for Beginners:
1. **`subplots` Function**:
   - Use `fig, ax = plt.subplots()` to create a blank canvas (`fig`) and an axis (`ax`) for plotting.
2. **Plotting**:
   - Use `ax.plot()` for line charts, `ax.bar()` for bar charts, etc.
3. **Customization**:
   - Titles: `ax.set_title()`
   - Axis Labels: `ax.set_xlabel()` and `ax.set_ylabel()`
