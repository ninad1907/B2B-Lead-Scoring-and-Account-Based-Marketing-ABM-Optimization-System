Here's how you can create these visualizations in Matplotlib:

---

### **Visualization 1: Two-Point Plots on the Same Graph**
This plot compares normalized poverty rates and high school graduation rates.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assuming `df` is your dataframe containing the data
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))

# Plot normalized poverty rates
plt.plot(df['normalized_poverty_rate'], marker='o', color='red', label='Poverty Rate')

# Plot normalized high school graduation rates
plt.plot(df['normalized_hs_rate'], marker='x', color='blue', label='HS Graduation Rate')

# Add labels, title, and legend
plt.xlabel('States')
plt.ylabel('Rates (Normalized)')
plt.title('Comparison of Normalized Poverty and High School Graduation Rates')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

---

### **Visualization 2: Scatter Plot**
This plot visualizes the relationship between normalized high school graduation rates and poverty rates.

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))

# Create scatter plot
plt.scatter(df['normalized_hs_rate'], df['normalized_poverty_rate'], color='purple', alpha=0.7)

# Add labels, title, and grid
plt.xlabel('Normalized HS Graduation Rate')
plt.ylabel('Normalized Poverty Rate')
plt.title('Scatter Plot: HS Graduation Rate vs Poverty Rate')
plt.grid(True)

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

### **Key Notes**
- **Figure Size:** The `figsize=(14, 7)` ensures the plots have the required size.
- **Markers and Colors:** Markers are customized to represent the two indicators effectively (red circles and blue x markers in the first plot).
- **Gridlines:** Added to make the plots more readable.
- **Legend:** Helps differentiate between the two indicators in the first visualization.
