apcinsfcs achzi ffqge obbmmm ajrfe...

>>> message.split() # this is our magic function
['apcinsfcs', 'achzi', 'ffqge', 'obbmmm', 'ajrfe', ...]

=> when are we meeting

hidden_message = []
for word in message.split():
    if word in known_english_words:
        hidden_message.append(word)

print(" ".join(hidden_message))
