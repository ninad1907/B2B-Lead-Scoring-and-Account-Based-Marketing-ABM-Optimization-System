Use the Check Activity button to validate your code. Don't worry if it fails, you can check your submission as many times as desired.

=> def nonogram_sequence(binary_array):
    sequence = []
    counter = 0
    for num in binary_array:
        if num == 1:
            counter += 1
        elif counter != 0:
            sequence.append(counter)
            counter = 0
    if counter:
        sequence.append(counter)
    return sequence
