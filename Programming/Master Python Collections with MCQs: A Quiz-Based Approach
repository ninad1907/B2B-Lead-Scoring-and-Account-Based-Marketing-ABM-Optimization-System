Which of the following is correct way to create a list

Which of the following is a valid way to create a list of integers from 0 to 99 using a list comprehension?


[x for x in range(100)]


[x if x % 2 == 0 for x in range(100)]


[x for x in range(1, 100)]


[x**2 for x in range(100)]

Correct!
The correct answer is [x for x in range(100)].
The range() function can be used to create a list of integers from 0 to 99. The x**2 expression is applied to each item in the list, resulting in a list of squares of integers from 0 to 99. The conditional expression x % 2 == 0 filters out odd integers, resulting in a list of even integers from 0 to 98.
