Scenario Question

You are working on a machine learning project to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service. The dataset you have includes customer information such as age, usage patterns, subscription type, and a unique customer ID for each record.

Why would using the customer ID as a feature for predicting churn be ineffective?
The customer ID is a unique identifier and does not contain predictive information regarding the likelihood of churn.
